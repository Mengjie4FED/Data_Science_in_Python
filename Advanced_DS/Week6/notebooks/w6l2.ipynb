    "## Introduction to Dimension Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson introduces dimension reduction, which is an important technique for reducing the number of features used to build a machine learning model. With these techniques, such as principal component analysis, a smaller number of new features are created from the original set of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "- explain how the principal component analysis algorithm operates,\n",
    "- explain the relationship between PCA components and explained variance,\n",
    "- apply the PCA algorithm by using the scikit learn library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximately 2 hours.\n",

    "### Activities\n",
