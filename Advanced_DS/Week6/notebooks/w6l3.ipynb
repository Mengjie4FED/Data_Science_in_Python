    "## Introduction to Manifold Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson introduces manifold learning, which enables the projection of high-dimensional data to a smaller set of dimensions. This can be useful both as a feature selection mechanisms for machine learning, and a technique that enables visualization of high-dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "- identify when manifold learning can be an effective tool,\n",
    "- explain the differences between the LLE, Isomap and t-SNE algorithms,\n",
    "- apply manifold learning algorithms by using the scikit learn library to generate a two-dimensional visualization, and\n",
    "- employ a feature union to generate an optimal set of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximately 2 hours.\n",

    "### Activities\n",

    "Reading: Learn about [Manifold Learning][jml]  and its application by using the scikit learn module in Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas. You can skip the _Example: Isomap on Faces_ and _Example: Visualizing Structure in Digits_ sections, which are optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Video: Watch the [introduction to manifold learning][imlv] video, which will demonstrate these concepts.\n",

    "Notebook: Read and complete the practice exercises in the [Introduction to manifold learning][intro2ml] notebook.\n",
