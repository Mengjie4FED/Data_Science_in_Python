    "When looking for data to use for text data processing, one of the more popular data sources is [Twitter][tw]. In this notebook, we introduce the Twitter API, and demonstrate how to use the Twitter API from within a Python gram to acquire and process tweets, or Twitter messages. First, we review the mechanisms by which an application authenticates with Twitter. Next, we discuss different techniques for interacting with the twitter data stream by using the twitter API. Finally, we construct a tweet sentiment analysis pipeline before applying this pipeline to new tweets from a specific user.\n",

    "Twitter tracks tweet data to identify topics or people that are being frequently mentioned, which is known as [_trending_][twtr]. The Twitter API enables an application to obtain a list of currently trending topics. These topics include metadata that can be used to learn more about trending topics. One component of the metadata is the physical location of the trending topic. This location is encoded as a [**WOEID**][woeid], which is a Yahoo developed standard that is short for _where on the earth ID_. In the first Code cell below, we demonstrate obtaining the locations of currently trending topics before displaying these physical locations. In the second Code cell, we display the complete metadata for one location, which can be used to obtain a list of trending topics for a particular location on Earth, via the WOEID. Note that since trending topics change, this notebook will provide different results when run at different times.\n",
