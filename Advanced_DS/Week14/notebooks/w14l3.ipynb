    "## Introduction to General Linear Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn about general linear models. A general linear model is a flexible approach to computing model fits to the observed data where the model errors can be non-Gaussian. As was the case with linear regression, the model terms can be non-linear, however, they can't include combinations of different terms. For example, a quadratic term is allowed, but we can't have `x1 * x2`. We will use the PyMC3 library to quickly and easily compute general linear models within a Bayesian framework.\n",
