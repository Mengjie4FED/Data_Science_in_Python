    "This lesson introduces the four types of data analytics that are commonly used in data science. Next, the basic tasks of machine learning are introduced, including data cleaning and pre-processing. Finally,  the four main categories of machine learning: classification, regression, clustering, and dimensional reduction are introduced as well as how to persist machine learning models.\n",
