    "In this notebook, we introduce text analytics, which is one of the most exciting application areas for machine learning. Text analytics forms the basis for [natural language processing][nlp], and is explicitly used for [sentiment analysis][sa], for [language identification][lc], for [spelling and grammar correction][sc], as well as for mining text data contained in forms, such as [medical informatics][mi]. Before moving into text classification and text mining, in this notebook we focus on basic text analytics such as accessing data, tokenizing a corpus, and computing token frequencies. We demonstrate these tasks by using basic Python concepts and by using functionality from within the scikit learn library. Finally, we introduce the NLTK library, and use methods within this library to perform these tasks.\n",

    "To get started with text analysis, we need texts to analyze. To get started, we will analyze the [twenty newsgroup][tng] data set. We first download this data (scikit learn has built in methods for doing this, however, we have cached a copy locally on our server). The data are made available via a custom object, but we can access the data of interest by using dictionary keys. Before delving into text analysis, we first explore this data over several Code cells to understand more about the task at hand.\n",

    "In case you are unaware, one primary use of the early Internet (i.e., pre-Web) was to share information among interested groups via newsgroups, or bulletin boards. Users could subscribe to these groups to send and receive postings of interest. This text classification problem uses postings to twenty newsgroups, thus the individual newsgroup is the classification target and the text in the postings are used to create the features. These postings were similar to emails, thus each posting will have a header, the article body, which might quote all or part of a previous message, and  possibly a footer (like an email signature). While we use the entire posting in these notebooks, you can have the header, quoted text, and the footer removed by scikit learn by including the remove attribute, and indicating whether these sections should be removed. This attribute can take one or all of the values: header, footer, and quotes. For example, the following attribute would be used to remove both headers and footers.\n",

One important item to consider, however, is that, by default, Python will search for sequences of characters in a text message. Thus, if a word is also part of larger words, we will over-count the occurrences, as demonstrated in the following Code cell.\n",

The second Code cell demonstrates tokenizing a text string, and using a [`Counter`][pc] to accumulate the number of unique occurrences of each token. Finally, we employ regular expressions to split a text string, and use the resulting tokens to create another `Counter` that can be used to compare the results of regular expression parsing with the default string tokenization. One benefit of using regular expressions is that we can specifically indicate of what a token should be composed, in this case, we state a token is a sequence of one or more alphanumeric characters surrounded by white space.

    "## Bag of Words\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple question about text data mining that you might have is _How does one classify documents made up of words when machine learning algorithms work on numerical data?_ The simple answer is we need to build a numerical summary of a data set that our algorithms can manipulate. A conceptually easy approach  to implement this idea is to identify all possible words in the documents of interest and to track the number of times each words occurs in specific documents. This produces a (very) sparse matrix for our sample of documents, where the columns are the possible words (or tokens) and the rows are different documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "This concept, where one tokenizes documents to build these sparse matrices is more formally known as _bag of words_, because we effectively create the [bag of words][bwd] out of which are documents are constructed. In the bag of words model, each document can be mapped into a vector, where the individual elements correspond to the number of times the words (associated with the particular column) appears in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "With scikit learn, we can use the [`CountVectorizer`][skcv] to break our document into tokens (in this case words), which are used to construct our _bag of words_ for the given set of documents. Given this tokenizer, we first need to construct the list of tokens, which we do with the `fit` method. Second, we need to transform our documents into this sparse matrix, which we do with the `transform` method. Since both steps use the same input data, there is a convenience method to perform both operations at the same time, called `fit_transform`.\n",

    "In the preceding Code cells, we used scikit learn to parse our sample text message by using `CountVectorizer`. If you look carefully, you will notice the default results are different than our standard Python text analysis. For example, note how we do not have the single character word `a` in the list of most common items. The reason is the default tokenizer for `CountVectorizer` removes single character words (as they are assumed to be uninformative). You can change this by providing a new regular expression to the `CountVectorizer` via the `token_pattern` parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have run the notebook, go back and make the following changes to see how the results change.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Change the `CountVectorizer` regular expression to the string `'(?u)\\\\b\\\\w+\\\\b'`, how do the results change?\n",
    "2. Try vectorizing a different message (i.e., transform a different message, or messages). How do the results change?\n",
    "3. You can have `CountVectorizer` text processing object remove accented words by setting the `strip_accents` parameter to `True`. Does setting this parameter change the results?"

    "The scikit learn library is a general purpose, Python machine learning library that does include some basic text analysis functionality. Text analysis, however is an extremely large and growing topic. As a result, we will want to explore an additional library for natural language processing. This library, known as [Natural Language ToolKit][nltk], or NLTK, enables a wide range of text analyses either on its own, or in conjunction with scikit learn. The NLTK library is extensive and includes [documentation][nltkd] covering many of the topics we have demonstrated previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this notebook, we will explore how to use NLTK to perform basic text analysis, in a similar manner as demonstrated earlier via standard Python and the scikit learn library. First we import the library, and tokenize the message. We create an NLTK frequency distribution by passing a list of words to the NLTK `FreqDist` method.\n",
