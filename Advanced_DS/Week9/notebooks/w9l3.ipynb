    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will be build on previous concepts to produce more powerful text mining applications. First, we will introduce the concept of stemming, where different forms of the same word are reduced to a common form. This can improve text mining accuracy by altering the frequency counts of different words or terms. Next, we will extend the bag of words concept to include n-grams, which are groups of n-words. The basic bag of words can be thought of as unigrams, or 1-grams. Higher order groupings include bigrams and trigrams, where words are taken as pairs or triples. n-grams can also improve the accuracy of text mining applications by introducing higher order associations. Finally, we will explore other machine learning concepts including dimension reduction and clustering as applied to text data.\n",
