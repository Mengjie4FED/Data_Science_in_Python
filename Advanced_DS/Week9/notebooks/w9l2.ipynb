    "## Introduction to Text Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will be introduced to techniques for classifying text documents, including to perform sentiment analysis. To improve machine classification of text documents, we will identify stop words and demonstrate how they can be removed from the analysis by using NLTK. Next, we will introduce the concept of frequency normalization, where we normalize the frequency of token or word occurrences across multiple documents. Formally, this is known as Term-Frequency, inverse document frequency, or TF-IDF. Finally, we will explore how text classification can be extended to perform sentiment analysis.\n",
