    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will be introduced to basic concepts in text analytics, starting with the conversion of a sequence of characters that make up a text document into numerical data that can be computationally processed. By parsing textual data into tokens, we can create a count of word occurrences within a document, which when normalized by the total number of words in the document, provides word frequencies. This collection of words contained within a document is formally known as a bag of words, and is a standard technique for text analytics. For multiple documents, or subsections within a single document, we can turn this bag of words into a matrix, where each row is a new document (or text item, like a tweet, email, or web page) and each column is a count (or frequency) of a specific word. Given the number of words, a document matrix can quickly become large, which introduces important computational issues that must be addressed in text analysis.\n",
