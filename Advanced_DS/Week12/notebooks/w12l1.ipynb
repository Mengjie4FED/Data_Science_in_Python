    "## Introduction to Network Analysis: Graph Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn basic graph concepts in network analysis. Specifically, we will start by introducing the concept of a node, and how nodes can be connected in a graph by edges. Next, we will contrast undirected and directed graphs, before discussing how graphs, nodes, and edges can all posses attributes. We will also explore the underlying graph matrix representations including the adjacency and incidence matrices. Finally, we will learn how to perform basic graph visualizations in Python.\n",
