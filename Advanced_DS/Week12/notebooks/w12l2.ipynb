    "In this lesson, you will learn about special types of graphs, including cycles, complete graphs, and complete bipartite graphs. Next, you will learn about traversing graphs, which can be done via a depth-first search, a breadth-first search, or a general exploration. Finally, you will learn about algorithms for analyzing the data represented by a graph to compute distance, diameter, and density by using the NetworkX Python library.\n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- explain the basic graph families including complete graphs, bipartite graphs, and cycles,\n",
    "- describe the analysis of graphs including the concepts of density, distance, diameter, and graph traversal, and\n",
    "- apply basic graph analysis techniques in Python by using NetworkX.\n",
