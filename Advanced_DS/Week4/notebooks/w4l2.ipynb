    "## Introduction to Model-Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson introduces model selection via cross-validation, which allows us to determine the optimal parameters for our selected machine learning algorithm while minimizing the effects of overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "- explain the concepts behind grid-search,\n",
    "- articulate how cross-validation can be used to select model hyperparameters,\n",
    "- apply grid search cross-validation by using the scikit learn library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximately 2 hours.\n",

    "### Activities\n",
    "\n",
    "Video: Watch the [Introduction to Model Selection][imsv] video, which will discuss a number of different approaches for identifying the optimal model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading: Read how [machine learning can amplify biases][der] in the training data to understand the ethical implications of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook: Read and complete the practice exercises in the [Introduction to Model Selection][intro2ms] notebook.\n",
