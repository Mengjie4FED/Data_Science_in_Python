    "In this lesson you will about in deep learning, currently one of the most popular forms of machine learning. First, we introduce deep learning by building on the basic concepts of neural networks. Next, we demonstrate how they can be applied in different contexts, such as image processing and analysis and natural language processing. Finally, in the course notebook, you will see how to use the Keras library to apply deep learning by using Python.\n",
