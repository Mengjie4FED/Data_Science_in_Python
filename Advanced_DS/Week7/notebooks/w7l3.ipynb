    "This lesson introduces Gaussian mixture models, which is a clustering model that assumes all data are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian (or normal) distributions.\n",

    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will\n",
    "\n",
    "- articulate the basic concepts behind mixture models,\n",
    "- explain how mixture models work to identify clusters, and\n",
    "- apply the Gaussian mixture model algorithm by using the scikit learn library to perform cluster analysis.\n",
