    "To include uncertainty in the decision making process, we require a statistical framework that supports probabilistic reasoning. Bayesian statistics is based on the premise that probability encodes our degree of belief in an event. Thus, by employing Bayesian statistics, we can model a process of interest that naturally includes any inherent uncertainty.\n",
