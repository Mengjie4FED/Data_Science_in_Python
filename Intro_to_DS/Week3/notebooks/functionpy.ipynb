    "The Python language supports the creation and application of user-defined functions, which can simplify program development by promoting code reuse (in a similar manner as importing packages developed by others, but in this case, you are the code provider and consumer). In Python, a function is actually an object, like everything else, and they can thus be created and passed dynamically like any other data type.\n",

    "A Python function is defined by using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name. After the function name is a set of matching parentheses that enclose any arguments to the function. A colon character follows the closing parenthesis, which signifies the start of the code block that provides the function implementation, which is known as the function body. As a simple example, the following function takes no arguments and simply prints a standard message:\n",

    "\n",
    "One last aspect of function arguments is that when a function is called, the argument names listed in the function definition can be explicitly specified, along with the values they should take when the function is called. This type of function call is said to be using _keyword arguments_. When using keyword arguments, the order of the arguments listed in the function call is arbitrary and does not need to explicitly match the argument order listed in the function definition. For example, we could call the hellolist function:\n",

    "A function can return values by using the `return` keyword. Single values are returned as the type of the value, while multiple values are returned as a tuple of values. These two cases are demonstrated in the following sample code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def hello2():\n",
    "   return \"Hello World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def hello3(name):\n",
    "    return \"Hello, \", name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling the first function in this sample code as `msg = hello2()` will assign the string `Hello World!` to the `msg` variable, while calling the second of these functions as `msg = hello3()` will assign the tuple `('Hello', name)` to the `msg` variable. Note that for the `hello3` function, the argument is not required, as written, to be a string; therefore, the return tuple will have a string as the first element and the second element will be the same type as the argument `name`.\n",
    "\n",
