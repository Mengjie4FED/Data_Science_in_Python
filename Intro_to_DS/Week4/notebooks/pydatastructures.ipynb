    "A sequence of zero or more characters that are enclosed within either a pair of single quote characters, `'`, or a pair of double quote characters, `\"`. A Python string is an instance of class `str`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`A string containing many characters`\n",
    "\n",
    "__Tuple__:\n",
    "An ordered sequence of zero or more values that are enclosed in parentheses, `(` and `)`. The different values in a tuple are generally separated by commas, although this is not required. A Python tuple is an instance of class `tuple`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)`\n",
    "\n",
    "__List__:\n",
    "An ordered sequence of zero or more values that are enclosed in square brackets, `[` and `]`. The different values in the list are separated by commas. A Python list is an instance of class `list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`\n",
    "\n",
    "__Dictionary__:\n",
    "An unordered collection of key-value pairs that are enclosed in curly braces, `{` and `}`. A key is separated from its corresponding value by a colon `:` and the different key-value entries in the collection are separated by commas. A Python dictionary is an instance of class `dict`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`d = {'name': \"Alexander\", 'age': 30, 'location': (102.1, 32.1)}`\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these four data structures, the _list_ and the _dictionary_ are mutable, which means the values stored in these structures can be changed. On the other hand,  the _string_ and the _tuple_ are immutable, which means the values cannot be changed once created. Instead, a new data structure must be created, either explicitly by the programmer, or implicitly by the Python interpreter. All of these data structures can be displayed by using the Python built-in `print` function, which converts its arguments to a string, which is then sent to STDOUT (which in this course is generally the space in the notebook immediately following the `print` statement):\n",
    "\n",

    "print(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The _dictionary_ is a special data structure that maps keys to values, and thus the keys, which can be stored in any order, are used to access the values. The other three structures are ordered sequences, and thus individual elements can be accessed by specifying an index position within square brackets, `[]`, with the caveat that Python is a zero-indexed language. Thus, given an ordered sequence `data`, the following accesses are legal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `a[0]`: access the first value\n",
    "- `a[1]`: access the second value\n",
    "- `a[-1]`: access the last value\n",
    "- `a[-2]`: access the second to last value\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports a rich array of techniques for extracting values from an ordered list beyond the single value access method, known as slicing. Given an ordered sequence `data`, the basic format is `data[start:end:stride]` where start and end are the starting and ending index values, respectively, and stride is the number of values to skip when iterating. If start or end are omitted, the default is the first and last value, while the default stride is one. A negative value can be used for either the start or the end index values, which indicates relative to the end value. These concepts are demonstrated in the following code block:"

    "\n",
    "In Python, a string is a sequence of zero or more characters that are enclosed within either a pair of single quote characters, `'`, or a pair of double quote characters, `\"`. While it might seem confusing to have two such similar representations, it can be quite handy, as this allows strings to be written that include either single quotes or double quote characters by simply using the opposite type to enclose the string itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"A string with a contraction such as don't or a possessive like Python's string.\"\n",
    "'A string with a quote, \"Four score and seven years ago ...\"'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A string can span multiple lines by using either three single or double quote characters to enclose the sequence of characters, just like multi-line comments. Adjacent strings on the same line will be silently combined by the Python interpreter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = 'First Name ''Last Name '\" Email Address\"\n",
    "print(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "First Name Last Name  Email Address\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A special string in Python is known as a _raw string_, where backslashes are not handled in a special way when processing the string. This is useful when constructing regular expressions or other strings that might include formatting information, like plot axes that use LaTeX formatting. To create a raw string, simply prefix the string with a lower-case `'r'`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data =r'Text with a \\ that is left unprocessed.'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `str` class defines a large number of functions that can be used to process string data, including testing if the string only contains alphabetical values, numerical values, or alphanumeric values, and functions that can convert a string to all lowercase or uppercase characters. A full description of the string methods is available from the online [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) or by using `help(str)` at a Python prompt or Jupyter Notebook cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the more useful Python _string_ functions are detailed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "__`format`__:\n",
    "\n",
    "The format method is used to create a new formatted string from a template string and substitution text. The classic example is a form letter, where specific fields are replaced by new data with every string. The `format` method replaces the previous `%` string formatting operator. In its basic form, the template string includes identified `{}` to indicate replacement string locations, and the format method takes arguments that are used to indicate the replacement text. For example,\n",

    "```python\n",
    "'Hello {}, you are visitor #{}!'.format('Alexander', 23)\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "'Hello Alexander, you are visitor #23!'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the curly braces can enclose a number that is used to find the matching variable for substitution in the `format` method. For example, the previous example could also be written as `'Hello {0}, you are visitor #{1}!'.format('Alexander', 23)`, or equivalently as `'Hello {1}, you are visitor #{0}!'.format(23, 'Alexander')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recent modification to the Python language provides support for [_f-strings_](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/), where a variable name is specified within the curly-braces, allow direct variable replacement. The string formatting codes are still supported, but now follow the variable name, as opposed to the ordinal number. For example, the following code example can be written by using an _f-string_:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = 'Alexander'\n",
    "number = 23\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"The brown dog jumped over the quick fox!\".find(\"he\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "returns 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "__`split`__:\n",

    "\"The brown dog jumped over the quick fox!\".split()\n",

    "__`strip`__:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `strip` method is used to remove characters specified as input arguments to the method from the beginning and end of a string. By default, whitespace characters are removed. Two variants of this function: `lstrip` and `rstrip` remove leading or trailing characters, respectively.\n",

A more efficient string combination approach is to use the `join` method, which can quickly combine multiple strings that are contained in an iterable object such as a `list` or `tuple` together. The string you use to call the join method provides the _glue text_ between each item in the iterable. For example, the following method will create a new string from a list of strings that are each separated by a comma and a single space character:\n",
