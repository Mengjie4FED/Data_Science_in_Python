    "As we discussed previously, the Python programming language provides a rich set of data structures such as the list, tuple, dictionary, and string, which can greatly simplify common programming tasks. Of these structures, all but the string are heterogeneous, which means they can hold data of different types. This flexibility comes at a cost, however, as it is more expensive in both computational time and storage to maintain an arbitrary collection of data than to hold a pre-defined set of data.\n",

    "## Optional: NumPy Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "(Advanced: Optional) For example, the Python list is implemented (in the [Cython](http://cython.org) implementation) as a variable length array that contains pointers to the objects held in the array. While flexible, it takes time to create, resize, and iterate over, even if the data contained in the list is homogenous. Also, even though you can create multiple-dimensional lists, creating and working with them is neither simple or intuitive. Yet, many applications require multi-dimensional representation; for example, location on the surface of the Earth or pixel properties in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, these data structures clearly are not designed or optimized for data intensive computing. Scientific and engineering computing applications have a long history of using optimized data structures and libraries, including codes written in C, Fortran, or MatLab. These applications expect to have vector and matrix data structures and optimized algorithms that can leverage these structures seamlessly.  Fortunately, since many data science applications, including statistical and machine learning, are built on this academic legacy, a community of open source developers have built the [Numerical Python (NumPy)](http://numpy.org) library, a fundamental numerical package to facilitate scientific computing in Python.\n",

    "NumPy is built around a new, n-dimensional array (`ndarray`) data structure that provides fast support for numerical computations. This data type for objects stored in the array can be specified at creation time, but the array is homogenous. This array can be used to represent a vector (one-dimensional set of numerical values) or matrix (multiple-dimensional set of vectors). Furthermore, NumPy provides additional benefits built on top of the `array` object, including _masked arrays_, _universal functions_, _sampling from random distributions_, and support for _user-defined, arbitrary data-types_ that allow the `array` to become an efficient, multi-dimensional generic data container.\n",

    "\n",
    "Despite the discussion in the previous section, you might be curious if the benefits of learning NumPy are worth the effort of learning to effectively use a new Python data structure, especially one that is not part of the standard Python distribution. In the end, you will have to make this decision, but there are several definite benefits to using NumPy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. NumPy is much faster than using a `list`.\n",
    "2. NumPy is generally more intuitive than using a `list`.\n",
    "3. NumPy is used by many other libraries like SciPy, MatPlotLib, and Pandas.\n",
    "4. NumPy is part of the standard **data science** Python distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a very powerful library, with a rich and detailed [user guide][1]. Every time I look through the documentation, I learn new tricks. Furthermore, NumPy is the foundation upon which other popular Python modules, such as Pandas and Seaborn, are based. The time you spend learning to use this library properly will be amply rewarded. In the rest of this IPython notebook, we will introduce many of the basic NumPy features, but to fully master this library you will need to spend time reading the documentation and trying out the full capabilities of the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the first two points, consider the programming task of computing basic mathematical functions on a large number of data points. In the first code block, we first import both the `math` library and the `numpy` library. Second, we define two constants: size, which is the number of data points to process, and delta, which is a floating point offset we add to the array elements. You can change these two parameters to see how the performance of the different approaches varies. Finally, we create the `list` and the NumPy `array` that we will use in the next few codes blocks:\n",

You have already seen examples of some of these functions at the start of this IPython Notebook when we compared the speed and simplicity of NumPy versus normal Python for numerical operations. These functions almost all include an optional `out` parameter that allows a pre-defined NumPy array to be used to hold the results of the calculation, which can often speed-up the processing by eliminating the need for the creation and destruction of temporary arrays. These functions will all still return the final array, even if the `out` parameter is used. \n",

    "- Bit-twiddling functions, which manipulate integer arrays as if they are bit patterns. Example functions include the `bitwise_and`, `bitwise_or`, `invert`, and `right_shift`.\n",
    "- Comparison functions, which can be called explicitly or implicitly when using standard comparison operators that compare two arrays, element-by-element, returning a new array of the same dimension. Example functions include `greater`, `equal`, `logical_and`, and `maximum`.\n",
