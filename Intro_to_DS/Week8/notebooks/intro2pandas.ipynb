    "One of the early criticisms of many in the data science arena of the Python language was the lack of useful data structures for performing data analysis tasks. This criticism stemmed in part from comparisons between the R language and Python, since R has a built-in _DataFrame_ object that greatly simplified many data analysis tasks. This deficiency was addressed in 2008 by Wes McKinney with the creation of [Pandas][1] (the name was originally an abbreviation of Panel data), and this module continues to be improved. To quote the Pandas documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Python has long been great for data munging and preparation, but less\n",
    ">so for data analysis and modeling. pandas helps fill this gap, enabling\n",
    ">you to carry out your entire data analysis workflow in Python without\n",
    ">having to switch to a more domain specific language like R.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pandas module introduces several new data structures like the `Series`, `DataFrame`, and `Panel` that build on top of existing tools like `numpy` to speed up data analysis tasks. Note that the `numpy` module provides support for numerical operations, including the generation of random data, which we will use in this notebook. You will learn more about `numpy` in a future lesson. The Pandas module also provides efficient mechanisms for moving data between in memory representations and different data formats, including CSV and text files, JSON files, SQL databases, HDF5 format files, and even Excel spreadsheets. Finally, the Pandas module also provides support for dealing with missing or incomplete data and aggregating or grouping data.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. `Series`: a one-dimensional labeled array that can hold any data type such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, or Python objects. A `Series` has both a data column and a label column called the _index_.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `DataFrame`: a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns that can be hold different data types, similar to a spreadsheet or relational database table. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Pandas module also provides a date/time data structure, sometimes refereed to as a `TimeSeries`, and a three-dimensional data structure known as a `Panel`. But of all of these, the `DataFrame` is the data structure we will use the most.\n",

    "### `Series`\n",

    "A `Series` is useful to hold data that should be accessible by using a specific label. For example, you might use time or dates to reference a specific financial transaction. You create a `Series` by passing in an appropriate data set along with an optional index:\n",

    "Since a `DataFrame` is essentially a two-dimensional analog of the one-dimensional `Series`, many of the same features extend from a `Series` to a `DataFrame`, including vectorized functions and mathematical operations (some of which are demonstrated later in this notebook). However, the differences between a `Series` and a `DataFrame` introduce several new issues due to the presence of multiple columns. Specifically, with a `DataFrame` one needs to be aware that each column might store different types of data; and, in addition, one now must be able to index to a particular row, a particular column, and to a particular field. \n",

    "The following code cells demonstrate the differences between a `Series` and a `DataFrame`, particularly when storing different types of data, and in directly accessing specific rows, columns, or subsections of a `DataFrame`. First, we access the `dtypes` attribute of our `DataFrame` to display the data types for all the columns. Next, we use the `describe` function to display summary statistics of the columns. Note that the `describe` function processes numerical columns differently than non-numerical columns. Finally, the `columns` attribute is used to display the columns names for the `DataFrame`, which can later be used to access a specific column or columns.\n",

    "Given a DataFrame, the selection of a subset of the `DataFrame` can be accomplished in a number of different ways, which can lead to some confusion. You can select one or more rows, one or more columns, or a combination of a set of rows and a set of columns. Formally, when selecting rows, we are slicing, and when selecting columns, we are indexing. Thus, with one exception, a new `DataFrame` can be selected from an existing `DataFrame` by the techniques listed in the following table.\n",

    "| `idf[0:2]`       | Select first two rows from `idf`         |\n",
    "| `idf['q':'w']`   | Select first two rows from `idf`         |\n",
    "| `df['A']`        | Select first column from `df`, return a **`Series`**, known as _dictionary-style_ index |\n",
    "| `df[['A']]`      | Select first column from `df`, return a `DataFrame`, known as explicit _list-style_ index |\n",
    "| `df[['B','D']]`  | Select second and fourth column from `df` |\n",
    "| `df[0:2][['A','C']]` | Select first and third columdn only from the first two rows from `df` |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the table, elements, one or more rows, or one or more columns can be accessed by using either the implicit label of a row and/or column, or by the explicit Python numerical index.  Thus, a single column can be directly accessed (as a `Series`) by using a dictionary style access with the column label, or (as a `DataFrame`) by using a list of column labels. If the list includes only one column label, a single column `DataFrame` is returned, otherwise a multiple column `DataFrame` is returned. Likewise, one or more rows can be accessed by using the row indices in a traditional slice notation or by using the explicit row labels as a list of strings (when they exist). \n",

    "In some cases, a data set being analyzed might have missing data (reasons for missing data will be explored in a subsequent lesson). Pandas can handle these cases in an elegant manner by assigning the `NaN` value to these cells. Furthermore, functions operating on a `DataFrame` (or `Series`) can handle these missing data in different manners, such as dropping any row or column with missing data, or, alternatively, imputing (or replacing) missing values with a substitute value. The substitute value can either be a constant value, such as zero, or a value computed from the `DataFrame` itself, such as the mean value of the column containing the missing entry. These techniques are demonstrated below by using the [`dropna`][dna] and [`fillna`][fna] functions, which drop rows containing a missing value or replace missing values, respectively. \n",
