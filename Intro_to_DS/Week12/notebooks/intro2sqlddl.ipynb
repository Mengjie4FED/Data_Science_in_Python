    "## Relational Database Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can begin to develop database applications, you need to understand the basic concepts. Relational databases hold data. This data can be of different types, such as numbers, characters, or dates. Within the database, the data are organized into logical units called tables. A table is like a spreadsheet, because it contains rows of data. Each row is made up of a number of columns. The columns hold data of a specific data type, like integer values or strings of characters. In most cases, a database has more than one table. To relate the tables together, a database designer takes advantage of natural (or artificial) links between the tables. In a spreadsheet, you can link rows in different sheets by cell values. The same idea holds in a relational database, and the column used to make the link is referred to as a key column.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier to understand the purpose of a table or a particular column, you should select appropriate names. The naming conventions can vary between databases. For a SQLite database, individual names: \n",
    "\n",
    "- by default, case insensitive (although this can be changed),\n",
    "\n",
    "- are unlimited in length, but should be kept to a reasonable length (given readability constraints),\n",
    "\n",
    "- must begin with a letter or an underscore character, and\n",
    "\n",
    "- must only code alphanumeric characters or underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can escape these rules by placing the name in double quotation marks, which allows names to be case sensitive and to include additional characters (including spaces). Doing this, however, is generally a bad practice: It requires the name to always be enclosed in double quotation marks and can easily confuse someone else who may be maintaining your code. Finally, a name can not be one of the reserved [keywords](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_keywords.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Style\n",
    "\n",
    "For this class, we will follow a specific style: All SQL commands are presented entirely in uppercase, and item names use camelCase. In camelCase style, words are joined together, and the first letter of each word-following the first one-is capitalized, such as aLongIdentifier. Combining these two styles together, these articles write SQL commands using the following style: `SELECT aLongIdentifier FROM dataTable ;`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Related tables are often grouped together into a schema. You can think of a schema as a container for all the related structure definitions within a particular database. A table name must be unique within a given schema. Thus, by using schemas, you can have identically named objects (such as tables) enclosed within different schemas. When you're using the Apache Derby database, a table is always in a schema. If you don't specify a schema explicitly, Derby implicitly uses the built-in apps schema. A second built-in schema called sys is used to isolate system tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the schema name to qualify a name. By default, SQLite uses the database name as the schema, and you do not need to prefix names to indicate the correct schema. For other databases, however, this is not the case. For these databases, you specify the schema name followed by a period and then the table name. For example, `bigdog.products` references the products table in the `bigdog` schema. Without the relevant schema name, a table name is said to be unqualified, as in products. When the schema name and the table name are completely specified, as in `bigdog.products`, the name is said to be fully qualified.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an abstract sense, these database concepts may seem confusing, but in practice they're fairly straightforward. For example, imagine you own a store called Bigdog's Surf Shop that sells a variety of items like sunglasses, shirts, and so on. If you want to be profitable, you must keep a close eye on your inventory so you can easily order additional inventory or change vendors to keep your overhead to a minimum. One simple method for tracking this information is to write entries in a table-like format:\n",
    "\n",
    "**<DIV ALIGN=CENTER>Product Table </DIV>**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Item# | Price | Stock Date | Description |\n",
    "| ---- | ----- | ---------- | ----------- |\n",
    "| 1 | 29.95 | 1/15/15 | Basic Sunglasses |\n",
    "| 2 | 9.95 | 12/14/14 | Generic Shirt |\n",
    "| 3 | 99.95 | 8/04/14 | Boogie Board |\n",
    "\n",
    "**<DIV ALIGN=CENTER>Vendors Table </DIV>**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Item# | Vendor# | Vendor Name |\n",
    "| ---- | ----- | ---------- | ----------- |\n",
    "| 1 | 101 | Mikal Arroyo |\n",
    "| 2 | 102 | Quiet Beach Industries |\n",
    "| 3 | 103 | Vista Luna |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From this simple visual design you can easily map the business logic straight into database tables. You have two database tables, `Products` and `Vendors`, which are naturally linked by the item number. The data types for the columns in each table are easy to determine. Later in this lesson we will actually create this sample schema for Bigdog's Surf Shop, which consists of these two tables, in a SQLite database. But first, we need to address how data is stored in a relational database table.\n",

    "## SQL: Structured Query Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Database systems can be complex pieces of software, especially when they scale to support enterprise-level applications. As a result, you may expect that every database has its own application programming interface (API) and that these APIs may be different from one system to the next. When relational databases were first developed, this was the case; but, fortunately, a number of vendors agreed to develop a standard language for accessing and manipulating relational databases. This language is officially called Structured Query Language (or SQL, pronounced sea-quill). Several official standard versions have been produced, including one in 1992 that is referred to as SQL-92, and one in 1999 that is referred to as SQL-99. The Apache Derby database provides a nearly complete implementation of the SQL-92 standard, so applications developed with Derby can be easily transported to other database systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL has two main components: a Data Definition Language (DDL) and a Data Manipulation Language (DML). DDL commands are used to create, modify, or delete items (such as tables) in a database. DML commands are used to add, modify, delete, or select data from a table in the database. The rest of this article provides a basic introduction to the DDL components of SQL. Future articles will focus on the DML commands and more advanced DDL commands. \n",

    "### SQL Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL, being a programming language in its own right, defines a rich data-type hierarchy. Persisting these data types is one of the most important responsibilities of the database. As databases have become more powerful, this type hierarchy has grown more complex. But most simple databases don't require the full range of allowed types, and often they need to store only numerical, character, and date or time data. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the SQL standard defines basic [data types][1], different database systems can support the standard to varying degrees. While this might seem odd, doing so provides more flexibility in allowing a particular implementation to achieve a market niche. In the case of SQLite, the design decisions support a compact, zero-configuration database file that is platform-independent. As a result, [SQLite does not support][2] a rich data type hierarchy, and instead focuses on ease-of-use. \n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite supports five storage classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NULL**: A null value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **INTEGER**: A signed integer, the number of bytes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8) used depends on the magnitude of the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **REAL**: A floating-point value stored as an 8 byte IEEE floating-point value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TEXT**: A string of character values stored in the default database encoding (e.g., UTF-8).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BLOB**: A blob of data stored *exactly* as is in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that SQLite does not support Boolean or Date/Time values directly. Instead, Boolean values are encoded as INTEGERs (0 = False, 1 = True). Likewise Date/Time values can be encoded either as TEXT, REAL, or INTEGER values. For full details, see the SQLite documentation. In addition, SQLite supports the concept of _Type Affinity_, whereby different data types can be easily mapped into each other. This simplifies moving schemas from other database systems to SQLite.\n",

    "#### The SQL NULL type\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin creating database tables, you must know what to do when no value is specified for a column. To illustrate this point, imagine that you've been asked to fill out a Web form. If you leave a particular column blank, what is inserted into the database? As you can imagine, this problem could be cumbersome if you had to track no value markers. Fortunately, SQL defines a special value, NULL, to indicate that a column has no value.\n",

    "### Create Table\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you've learned how to design a table, including mapping out the\n",
    "table columns and defining the data type for each column. After you've\n",
    "properly designed a table, the method for creating a table in SQL is\n",
    "straightforward. Listing 1 shows the formal syntax for creating a table\n",
    "in Derby.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-- Comment describing the purpose and layout of the table \n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE tableName ( { <columnDefinition> | <tableLevelConstraint> } \n",
    "    [, { <columnDefinition> | <tableLevelConstraint> } ]* ) ;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may feel bewildered after looking at this syntax for the first time.\n",
    "But it's easy to follow once you have the basics down. The square\n",
    "brackets ([ and ]) enclose optional parameters. As you can see from the\n",
    "formal syntax, any column definitions or table-level constraints after\n",
    "the required initial one (it wouldn't make sense to create a table with\n",
    "no columns!) are optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably understand what is meant by a column definition, but you\n",
    "might not understand the idea of a constraint. Constraints come in two\n",
    "types: table-level constraints and column constraints. A constraint\n",
    "limits either a column or a table in some manner. For example, you can\n",
    "use a constraint to require that a column always be assigned an actual\n",
    "value (no NULL values), or that every entry in a column must be unique,\n",
    "or that a column is automatically assigned a default value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The asterisk (\\*) after the last closing square bracket indicates that\n",
    "more than one of the enclosing items can be included. This implies that\n",
    "the table must have one or more columns or table-level constraints. The\n",
    "vertical line (|) indicates an either/or condition. In this syntax\n",
    "example, you must either define a new column or define a new table-level\n",
    "constraint. The curly brackets ({ and }) group related items together,\n",
    "and the parentheses (( and )) are required elements. Finally, the\n",
    "semicolon (;) indicates the end of a SQL statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SQLite Schema Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code block, we create our schema for Bigdog's Surf\n",
    "Shop, which includes two new tables: `myProducts` and `myVendors`. The\n",
    "myProducts table has four columns: itemNumber, price, stockDate, and\n",
    "description. The itemNumber column provides a unique identity for each\n",
    "item (or row) and has an attached column-level constraint that enforces\n",
    "a valid value to always be supplied (NOT NULL). Without this\n",
    "requirement, the itemNumber column isn't guaranteed to be unique because\n",
    "multiple columns could be assigned a NULL value. The price column is\n",
    "created as a REAL data type. The last two columns are simple: The\n",
    "stockDate column is stored as a TEXT (we can use application logic to\n",
    "transform the date/time information into and out of the appropriate\n",
    "YYYY-MM-DD format), and description is also stored in a TEXT field.\n",
    "\n",
    "The myVendors table has three columns: itemNumber, vendorNumber, and\n",
    "vendorName. In this case, both the itemNumber and vendorNumber columns\n",
    "have attached column-level constraints (NOT NULL). In addition, the\n",

    "## SQL Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "As the previous code blocks demonstrated, we can write SQL commands into a script file that can be easily executed by the `sqlite3` client. While this might seem like overkill given the simplicity of our current schema, it is actually a useful technique. Often, you'll need to execute multiple, complex commands. To simplify debugging a set of complex SQL commands,  it's generally easier to write them in a text file and then execute the commands in the text file all at once. By placing SQL commands in a script file, you gain the additional benefit of being able to execute the commands as many times as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "A script file is just a plain text file that contains a combination of SQL commands and SQLite commands that can be run directly from the `sqlite3` tool. A script file simplifies the development and maintenance of relational databases and provides a self-documenting technique for building databases. You should store these files as ASCII text files, not as RTF files (or any other format), to prevent text-encoding errors. Some text applications may try to automatically save your file as a rich text file. Be careful to avoid doing so, or you may have problems when you try to execute your script file. For this reason, you probably will want to always create and edit your SQL scripts at the Unix command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our previous script file, `create.sql`, includes several lines that start with two dashes (--). These lines are SQL comments; you should use them to provide a basic description of the purpose of each major component within the script file. The first actual commands ion the script file are SQL DROP statements that delete the `myProducts` and `myVendors` tables from the database. If the tables don't exist (which is the case if the database was just created), an error message is displayed; but as the preceding SQL comments indicate, you can safely ignore those messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "You first drop the tables, if they exist, so that you can cleanly create new tables with the exact column definitions you need. The next two SQL statements do just that, creating the myProducts and myVendors tables. To run this script file, we can either have the `sqlite3` client tool read the file form _STDIN_, as shown above, or we can start `sqlite3` and use the `.read` command to read and execute SQL commands from our `create.sql` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What if something goes wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, no matter how hard you try, things don't work out quite right. If you can't safely execute the create.sql script, there are a number of possibilities to check:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be sure the SQLite client tool starts up properly. You can do this at the Unix command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be sure you have free disk space in which to create a new database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be sure you have proper permissions (to read the script file and to create the new database) in the directory where you try to execute the script file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be sure your script file is a simple ASCII text file (and not an RTF file).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the output of the `!sqlite3 test \".schema\"` matches the data in the `create.sql` file, congratulations are in order. You now have a new test database with two new tables ready to hold data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll focus on the process of inserting data into a table by using SQLite. To follow along, you will need a SQLite database with the `myProducts` table available. If you haven't already done so, you should execute the `create.sql` script file.\n",
