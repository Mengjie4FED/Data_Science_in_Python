    "\n",
    "One of the most important tasks when you're building a database application is inserting data into the database. It doesn't matter how good the database software is-if you put bad data in a database, nothing else matters. There are several different ways to insert data into a database, but the rest of this lesson focuses on inserting data into a SQLite database by using the SQL INSERT statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can insert data into a SQLite database using the SQL INSERT statement, you must know how to properly use this statement. The full syntax for the SQL INSERT statement is\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO table-Name\n",
    "    [ (Simple-column-Name [ , Simple-column-Name]* ) ]\n",
    "\t  Expression\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which should seem familiar. As discussed previously, the square brackets (`[]`) enclose optional parameters. The only component whose purpose isn't immediately clear is _Expression_; but how complex can that simple phrase be? Of course, appearances can be deceiving; the Expression term can expand to one of four different structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a single-row VALUES list\n",
    "- a multiple-row VALUES list\n",
    "- a SELECT expression\n",
    "- a UNION expression\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these, the last two are beyond the scope of this notebook. The first two are similar; the only difference is that the first form inserts one row into a table, whereas the latter form inserts multiple rows into a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the optional part of the SQL INSERT statement to specify the column order of the values being inserted into the table. By default, data is inserted into a table's columns in the same order that the columns were listed when the table was created. Sometimes you may want to change this order or perhaps only specify values for columns that have NOT NULL constraints. By explicitly listing the columns in your SQL INSERT statement, you gain more control of the operation and can more easily handle these specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for the SQL VALUES expression is fairly simple,\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "{\n",
    "    VALUES ( Value {, Value }* )\n",
    "        [ , ( Value {, Value }* ) ]* |\n",
    "    VALUES Value [ , Value ]*\n",
    " }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This syntax displays the multiple-row format first, followed by the single-row format (remember that the vertical line character, `|`, means or and that the asterisk character, `*`, means one or more). The _value_ term stands for a value that you want to insert into a specific column. To insert data into multiple columns, you must enclose the data for a row in parentheses separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown below, to insert data into a table, you first need to to make sure that the table exists. If you haven't already done so, execute the table creation scripts discussed in the SQL DDL notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO myProducts \n",
    "    VALUES(1, 19.95, '2015-03-31', 'Hooded sweatshirt') ;\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO myProducts(itemNumber, price, stockDate, description) \n",
    "    VALUES(2, 99.99, '2015-03-29', 'Beach umbrella') ;\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO myProducts(itemNumber, price, stockDate) \n",
    "    VALUES(3, 0.99, '2015-02-28') ;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example presents three single-row inserts into the `myProducts` table. The first SQL INSERT statement doesn't provide a list of columns; it inserts an `itemNumber`, a `price`, a `stockDate`, and a `description`. Notice that the values inserted into both the `stockDate` and `description` columns are enclosed in single quote characters. The `description` column is a TEXT field, so it expects a string (which you indicate by enclosing the character data within single quotes). The `stockDate` column is also a TEXT field; as part of our application logic, we could pass in dates in the correct day, month, and year format. (For more guidance on the format of data types during a SQL INSERT operation, read the SQLite documentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second SQL INSERT statement explicitly lists all four columns and inserts new values appropriately. The final SQL INSERT statement lists only three columns and inserts only three values. The `description` column is left empty, which means it will have a NULL value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although single-row SQL INSERT statements can be useful, when you need to insert multiple rows, it's more efficient to do so directly, as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO myProducts(itemNumber, price, stockDate, description)\n",
    "VALUES (4, 29.95, '2015-02-10', 'Male bathing suit, blue'),\n",
    "       (5, 49.95, '2015-02-20', 'Female bathing suit, one piece, aqua'),\n",
    "       (6, 9.95, '2015-01-15', 'Child sand toy set'),\n",
    "       (7, 24.95, '2014-12-20', 'White beach towel'),\n",
    "       (8, 32.95, '2014-12-22', 'Blue-striped beach towel'),\n",
    "       (9, 12.95, '2015-03-12', 'Flip-flop'),\n",
    "       (10, 34.95, '2015-01-24', 'Open-toed sandal') ;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we insert seven rows into the database by explicitly listing all four columns and providing new values for each row. As discussed earlier, multiple-row inserts enclose the values for each new row within parentheses, and these values are separated by commas. \n",
    "\n",
    "To actually execute these statements, we can place the SQL INSERT statements in a script file and run the script to insert the data. This approach allows you to more easily fix errors or to later reinsert the data if necessary without recreating the requisite SQL INSERT statements. In the following code cells, we first create a SQL INSERT script file, before executing this script by using the `sqlite3` client tool. After this, we use the `.dump` command in the `sqlite3` client tool to display the full schema and contents of this SQLite database.\n",

    "### SQL Select\n",
    "\n",
    "In the SQL programming language, the task of performing a query falls to the SELECT statement. To provide all the query functionality required by database applications, the SELECT statement's capabilities are extensive. Before looking at example SELECT statements, lets first look at the  formal syntax of SELECT, which, as shown below is actually simple. The basic format is `SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE;`, you select the columns of interest from rows in a table or tables where certain conditions are satisfied. Of course, things can become considerably more complex. This section covers the basic features of SELECT and defers the more advanced issues to the official documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT [ DISTINCT | ALL ] SelectItem [ , SelectItem ]*\n",
    "FROM clause\n",
    "[ WHERE clause ]\n",
    "[ GROUP BY clause ]\n",
    "[ HAVING clause ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From this you can see that a basic SELECT statement requires only a SELECT and a FROM; you must specify what data to select and indicate the location of the data of interest. Everything else is optional (as indicated by the square brackets). The DISTINCT and ALL keywords are optional qualifiers to indicate that either rows with unique values or all rows should be selected, respectively. By default, ALL is implicitly assumed, and you can use only one DISTINCT qualifier per SELECT statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "A SELECT statement can have multiple columns listed following the SELECT keyword. Multiple elements (or, more generally, column names) are separated by commas. For example, `SELECT a, b, c` selects the three columns `a`, `b`, and `c`. To select all columns from a table, you can use the asterisk character (`*`) as a shorthand for all columns. An important point to remember is that the result of any SELECT statement is a transient SQLite table, and you can use it in many of the same ways you use a more permanent table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FROM component of a SELECT statement indicates from which table (or multiple tables) the data will be extracted. For now, we will focus on selecting data from a single table; latter we will cover table joins and selecting data from multiple tables. In this case, the fully qualified name of the table to query must follow the FROM keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the SELECT statement is optional. Before you build your first query, however, lets review the order in which the SELECT statement components are evaluated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. FROM clause\n",
    "2. WHERE clause\n",
    "3. GROUP BY clause\n",
    "4. HAVING clause\n",
    "5. SELECT clause\n",
    "\n",
    "When you break down the process SQLite follows when processing a query, this order is intuitive. First, you must locate the data to be analyzed, after which you filter out the rows of interest. The next steps are to group related rows and, finally, to select the actual columns of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate a SELECT statement, we can extract all the columns from the `myProducts` table by using the `sqlite3` tool and passing the SQL statement in as a command line argument.\n",

In a database application, if you always assume that the column names and their order in a table are fixed, you may end up with subtle bugs if someone else modifies the database tables on which your application depends.

Tables can be joined either explicitly, by using the JOIN keyword, or implicitly, by using a WHERE clause.\n",

An inner join is essentially the intersection of two tables, where the tables are matched by comparing the values of a key column, such as `itemNumber`. The resulting table is composed of only rows that were matched between the two tables. An outer join is more like a union of two tables, where the tables are matched by comparing the values of a key column, but non-matching rows are still included in the resulting table and filled with NULL values as appropriate. Writing SQL queries that use these more advanced table joins is beyond the scope of this notebook, to learn about these joins, refer to the official database documentation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Selecting columns from a database provides a number of useful benefits, but being able to compute and select quantities based on data in a table opens up even more possibilities. SQLite, as does any SQL-complaint database, provides several mathematical operators. The most common of which are listed in the following table, which you can use in either a SELECT clause or a WHERE clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "|Operator | Example | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- | ---- |\n",
    "| unary `+` | `+1.0` | A no-op, or no operation, as +4 = 4 |\n",
    "| unary `-` | `-p.price` | Changes the sign of the value to which it's applied |\n",
    "|`+`| `p.itemNumber + 10` | Adds the second value to the first value |\n",
    "|`-`| `p.itemNumber - 10` | Subtracts the second value from the first value |\n",
    "|`*`| `p.price * 1.0825` | Multiplies the first value by the second value |\n",
    "|`/`| `p.price / 100.0` | Divides the first value by the second value |\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these operators is straightforward because they generally behave exactly as you expect. For example, if the sales tax is 8.25%, you can return the price for an item both before and after sales tax has been applied by using `SELECT price, price * 1.0825 FROM myProducts ;`. As another example, if you have a column called `numberItems` that tracks the number of items purchased and another column called `price` that contains the price at which they're purchased, you can return the total amount paid for those items at a given price by using  `numberItems * price`. Several of the queries shown in this notebook provide additional examples of how to use these operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only concern when using these operators arises from complications that result from using different data types, such as integer or floating-point, in a mathematical operation. If both operands are the same data type, the result type will be the same. If you're performing division, this can result in truncation (for example, if you're using two integer values), which might cause unexpected problems. On the other hand, if the two operands are different data types, the result type is promoted to the more complex type."

    "SQL is a powerful and expressive language that can be used to perform a wide range of actions. Part of the SQL language's power comes from its ability to directly interact with a variety of data types. Some of the greatest power of a relational database arises from the inherent functions that it provides and from the extensibility enabled by allowing users to create new functions. SQLite provides functions (see the following [SQLite tutorial][1] for more information) in three different categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Core functions](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html)\n",

    "3. [Date and Time functions](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these built-in functions, we will most likely use the aggregate functions, which operate on multiple rows. Aggregate functions-also known as set functions in SQL-92 or, more informally, as column functions-return a computed quantity from a column over a number of rows. SQLite supports the following five aggregate functions (a sixth function, `group_concat`, is not listed).\n",
    "\n",
    "| Function | Example | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| `AVG` | `AVG(p.price)` | Returns the average value of a column from all rows that satisfy an expression. Can only be used with built-in numeric data types. The precision of the returned value is defined by the precision of the column being evaluated. |\n",
    "| `COUNT` | `COUNT(p.price)` | Returns the number of rows that satisfy an expression, such as a query. Can be used with any data type. |\n",
    "| `MAX` | `MAX(p.price)` | Returns the maximum value of a column from all rows that satisfy an expression. Can only be used with built-in data types. |\n",
    "| `MIN` | `MIN(p.price)` | Returns the minimum value of a column from all rows that satisfy an expression. Can only be used with built-in data types. |\n",
    "| `SUM` | `SUM(p.price)` | Returns the sum of a column over all rows that satisfy an expression. Can only be used with built-in numeric data types. |\n",
    "\n",
    "These aggregate functions can often be used to quickly find useful information that might otherwise be difficult to identify, as shown in the following code sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(p.itemNumber) AS Number, \n",

The `COUNT` function indicates that the table includes ten rows (because the query didn't use a WHERE clause to restrict the rows selected from the table). The `AVG` function calculates the average price of all items in the `myProducts` table. Finally, the `MIN` and `MAX` functions extract the minimum and maximum dates from the `myProducts` table.\n",

Because you can't do a simple join within an UPDATE statement, you must include a subquery in the WHERE clause to extract the `itemNumber` rows that correspond to products from Quiet Beach Industries. The WHERE clause in the UPDATE statement uses the `IN` operator to select those rows that have an `itemNumber` column in the set of values selected by the embedded query.\n",

A scalar subquery is an embedded query that returns a single row that contains a single column-essentially, a single value, which is known as a scalar. You can use a scalar subquery to select a specific value that will be used in the expression of the WHERE clause. For example,  `itemNumber = (Scalar Subquery)` updates any rows that have a  value in the `itemNumber` column that matches the result of the  scalar subquery.\n",
