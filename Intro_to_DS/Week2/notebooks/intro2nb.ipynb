    "The [Jupyter notebook][i] is a browser based scientific notebook, and is, therefore, extremely useful for learning and doing data science tasks. While [Jupyter][1] initially supported the [Python][2] programming language, via the [IPython kernel][ipyk], Jupyter now supports many  additional programming languages, including [R][3], [Julia][4], and [Haskell][5]. In addition, you can directly embed scripts, including [Bash shell][6] scripts, within a cell. This technology has gained tremendous popularity quite rapidly, and is continuing to be developed as [Project Jupyter][6], which highlights the programming language agnostic view the notebook concept has embraced. In addition, the Jupyter team develops and maintains a set of [Docker images][7] to simplify the adoption of notebooks.\n",

    "Our coverage of most of these topics will be brief, and given the time limitations of this course, some topics will be covered in more detail in subsequent lessons. For some topics, links will be provided for more detailed reference; a good example is Jupyter's [Rich Output][9] capabilities. However, we will explore some topics, such as writing and executing code, in more detail through the rest of this course. \n",

    "The Jupyter team has provided a nice [introduction to working][10] in an IPython Notebook, including how to use the menu commands, toolbar, and keyboard shortcuts. Of these, the most important points are to use the mouse to select a cell by single-clicking, and to enter a cell for editing by double-clicking. To have the IPython kernel process a cell, you can either enter control-return, which processes and remains in the current cell, or shift-return, which processes the cell and advances to the next cell. Finally, another important keyboard trick is to place a question mark, `?`, at the end of a IPython magic or Python keyword to bring up an IPython message window that provides online details for the magic or keyword.\n",

This is useful, as we will see throughout this course, both when developing, but also when executing code. For example, the following code block slowly prints out a series of numbers, by default the integers from 0 to 19. When we execute the cell, the integers slowly print out while we are free to edit or run code in other cells."
