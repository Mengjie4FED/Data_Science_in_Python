    "Previously, we have looked at different data formats, including the CSV, JSON and XML text-based formats. In this notebook, we explore how to actually pull data of interest out of  semi-structured and structured text data. To do this, we begin by reviewing the concept of parsing, where we use the structure of a document to extract contextual information. Next, we move on to parsing structured documents, for which we use the parsing tool [BeautifulSoup][bs]. This library provides an elegant and simple method to parse and access XML formatted data, which includes HTML and SVG documents. BeautifulSoup was actually designed to simplify the task of scraping data from websites; thus we can use it to parse any XML formatted data. \n",

    "\n",
    "There are at least two techniques used to parse a structured file like an XML document. The first approach is known as [Simple API for XML][sax] (or SAX), which is an event driven parser that reads and processes each part of an XML document sequentially. The second approach is the [Document Object Model][dom] (or DOM), which reads and parses the entire document. While the SAX approach can be fast and uses a smaller memory footprint, the DOM approach can be more easily used to extract all or most of the information contained in an XML document. \n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate using a DOM, we can process our newly minted [HTML file](test.html), which is rendered rather simply as shown in the following figure:\n",

    "![HTML DOM view](images/html-dom.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "This figure is actually a screenshot from the Safari Web Browser _Developer Source View_, other browsers provide similar functionality (although you may  need to install an add-on package).  This representation of the DOM very clearly illustrates the hierarchical nature of the document. At the highest level we have the `html` element, inside of which are two separate elements: `body` and `head`. \n",

    "Looking at the document tree more closely, we see that the `head` element has an associated `id` and `class` attributes as well as a child element called `title`, which has a value of  `Test, this is only a test ...`. The `body` element has a number of children elements, including the `header`, `h2`, `p`, `ul`, `table`, and `footer` elements. Some of these elements have both child elements, values, and possibly their own attributes. The relationship between the DOM element and the HTML view can be seen in the following two figures, where the `ul` element is highlighted in the DOM model, \n",

This library uses an XML/HTML parser to build a DOM tree, and Beautiful Soup then provides traversal methods to access and modify the DOM for a specific document. BeautifulSoup has been extremely popular for the ease with which it allows web scraping, for example, you can pull data out of an HTML table. But it is more powerful than this, as it allows you to easily parse and manipulate any XML document.\n",

    "To use Beautiful Soup, we first need to import the library, and then create a BeautifulSoup object that provides access to the parsed data. Document elements, like `body` or `table` are directly accessed from the parsed tree; and element attributes or data can be easily extracted, deleted, or replaced. If required, new data can also be added to an existing document, allowing for the dynamic creation of a new document. These capabilities are demonstrated in the following code cells.\n",

    "## Using Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "While Beautiful Soup provides a great deal of power and simplicity in DOM parsing and element retrieval, the full power of parsing a document requires the use of regular expressions. We introduced regular expressions in a previous lesson; for completeness, however, we briefly review their use in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions, or RE or regexes, are expressions that can be used to match one or more occurrences of a particular pattern. Regular expressions are not unique to Python, they are used in many programming languages and many Unix command line tools like `sed`, `grep`, or `awk`. [Regular expressions][re] are used in Python through the `re` module. Given a regular expression, the first task in Python is to compile the RE, which is done by using the `compile` method in the `re` module. \n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate this approach in the following Code cell, where we now parse a much larger document, the airport XML document created in an earlier lesson. Below, we use a regular expression to find and display the element containing `CMI` to display our local airport.\n",
